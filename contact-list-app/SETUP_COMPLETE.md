## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Started

### 1. Set Up Supabase (Required)

You'll need to create a Supabase project and configure it:

#### A. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose a name, database password, and region
4. Wait for project to finish setting up (~2 minutes)

#### B. Run the Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

This creates:

- The `contacts` table
- Row Level Security policies
- Automatic timestamp triggers

#### C. Get Your API Credentials

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **API**
2. Copy:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (the `anon` key under "Project API keys")

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials!

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### 4. Create Your First Account

1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Enter your email and password (min 6 characters)
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Sign in with your new account
5. Start adding contacts!

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's in `.gitignore`)
   - Keep your Supabase credentials secure
   - Use different Supabase projects for dev/prod

2. **Database**

   - The schema includes automatic timestamps
   - RLS policies protect user data
   - You can view your data in the Supabase dashboard

3. **Development**

   - Run `npm run dev` for hot-reload development
   - Run `npm run build` to test production builds
   - Check the console for any errors

4. **Customization**
   - Colors are defined in `app/globals.css`
   - UI components are in `components/ui/`
   - Add more fields to contacts in the schema and forms

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **Build Time:** The application includes fallback values for Supabase credentials during build time, so `npm run build` will work even without environment variables set
- **Client-Side Rendering:** All pages with Supabase interactions use `"use client"` and are dynamically rendered
- **Middleware:** Authentication is enforced at the middleware level for better security

---

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

Want to extend the app? Here are some ideas:

1. **Add More Fields**

   - Birthday, address, social media links
   - Custom fields per contact

2. **Contact Groups**

   - Tag contacts with categories
   - Filter by group/tag

3. **Export/Import**

   - Export contacts to CSV
   - Import from CSV or vCard

4. **Search Enhancements**

   - Advanced filters
   - Sort by name, date added, etc.

5. **Communication**
   - Track interaction history
   - Add notes/comments per contact

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

- Check your `.env.local` file exists
- Verify credentials are correct from Supabase dashboard
- Restart the dev server after changing env vars

### Build Fails

- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run build`
- Verify all files are saved

### Can't Sign In

- Verify Supabase is running (check dashboard)
- Check the schema was run correctly
- Look for errors in the browser console

### Contacts Don't Show Up

- Verify you're logged in as the correct user
- Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- Refresh the page

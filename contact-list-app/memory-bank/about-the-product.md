# ðŸ§­ About the Product

## Product Name
Contact Management Web App

## Purpose
A lightweight, modern web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their personal or professional contacts. Designed for individual users or small teams who need a simple yet secure way to store and access contact information.

## Problem Statement
Existing contact management tools are often bloated, expensive, or lack privacy control. This app provides a focused, user-friendly solution that integrates seamlessly with Supabase for secure, user-specific data storage.

## Target Audience
- Freelancers managing client contacts  
- Small business owners or team leads  
- Individual professionals needing a personal contact manager  
- Developers seeking a simple, extensible base project

## Core Value Proposition
A privacy-first, efficient contact manager built with modern web technologies, enabling quick access, CRUD operations, and scalability via Supabase.

## Key Goals
- Provide a responsive and intuitive interface for managing contacts  
- Maintain data integrity and privacy through RLS policies  
- Support CRUD operations through Supabase + Next.js App Router  
- Deploy quickly to Vercel with minimal setup friction

## MVP Deliverables
- Fully functional CRUD flow for contacts  
- Authentication and user isolation via Supabase  
- Clean UI with shadcn/ui  
- Live deployment on Vercel

## Post-MVP Goals
- Add contact grouping or tagging  
- Import/export contacts via CSV  
- Integrate email/contact syncing (optional future feature)  
- Implement soft delete and recovery  
- Introduce dark mode and enhanced theming

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React Server Components, shadcn/ui  
- **Backend:** Supabase (database + auth)  
- **State Management:** SWR for caching, Server Actions for mutations  
- **Deployment:** Vercel (with MCP server integration)

## Competitive Advantage
- Uses open, modern frameworks (Next.js + Supabase)  
- Easy to self-host or extend  
- Simple, non-enterprise-focused contact management  

## Long-Term Vision
To evolve into a modular, customizable CRM foundation that small teams or developers can fork and adapt to their workflow needs.

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Phase 2: Smoke Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these features:

#### ‚úÖ Authentication

- [ ] Visit your deployed URL
- [ ] Click "Sign Up" and create a test account
- [ ] Verify you receive the signup confirmation
- [ ] Sign in with your new account
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/contacts` page

#### ‚úÖ CRUD Operations

- [ ] **Create**: Add a new contact with all fields
- [ ] **Read**: Verify the contact appears in the list
- [ ] **Read**: Click on a contact to view details
- [ ] **Update**: Click "Edit" and modify the contact
- [ ] **Update**: Verify changes are saved
- [ ] **Delete**: Delete a contact with confirmation
- [ ] **Delete**: Verify contact is removed

#### ‚úÖ Search & Filter

- [ ] Use the search bar to find contacts by name
- [ ] Search by email
- [ ] Search by company

- [ ] Test on mobile device (responsive design)
- [ ] Check all buttons and links work
- [ ] Verify loading states appear correctly

#### ‚úÖ Security

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check that `contact-list-app` is set as the Root Directory
- Verify all environment variables are added correctly
- Check the build logs for specific errors

### "Invalid API Key" Error

- Verify environment variables are copied exactly (no extra spaces)
- Make sure both variables are set for all environments
- Redeploy after adding/fixing environment variables

### Authentication Not Working

- Check Supabase project is active (not paused)
- Verify the Supabase URL and key match your project
- Check browser console for specific error messages

### Can't See Contacts

- Verify you're logged in with the correct account
- Check Row Level Security policies in Supabase dashboard
- Look at Network tab to see if API calls are succeeding

---

## Vercel Dashboard Features

After deployment, you can:

- **View Deployments**: See all your deployments and their status
- **Analytics**: Monitor page views and performance
- **Logs**: View runtime and build logs
- **Domains**: Add custom domains to your project
- **Environment Variables**: Update credentials without redeploying

---

## Continuous Deployment

Your app is now set up for continuous deployment!

**What this means:**

- Every time you push to the `main` branch on GitHub
- Vercel automatically builds and deploys your changes
- You'll get a new production deployment with the latest code

**Preview Deployments:**

- Pull requests get their own preview URLs
- Test changes before merging to main

---

## Production URL

After successful deployment, your Contact Manager will be live at:

üåê **`https://[your-project-name].vercel.app`**

Share this URL with others to let them use your Contact Manager!

---

## Phase 2 Complete! üéâ

Once you've completed all the smoke tests, Phase 2 is done!

### What's Next?

**Phase 3: Post-MVP Enhancements** (Optional)

- Add contact grouping/tagging
- Implement CSV import/export
- Enhanced theming options
- Performance optimizations
- Additional features as needed

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Vercel build logs
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check Supabase dashboard for database/auth issues

Happy deploying! üöÄ
